**2. Specific Observations of Any Suspicious or Inconsistent Behaviors:**

**3. Opinion on Whether the Candidate was Likely Cheating or Being Dishonest:**
The consistent absence of eye contact, minimal hand movements, and high levels of fear during the interview are signs that warrant further investigation.

**4. Recommendations for the HR Recruiter:**
- Schedule a follow-up meeting with the candidate to address any concerns about their demeanor during the initial interview and evaluate their responses in person or via video call.
- Incorporate behavioral-based questions into the interview process to gauge the candidate's honesty, reliability, and ability to communicate openly and honestly.
