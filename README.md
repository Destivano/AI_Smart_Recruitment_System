# AI Smart Recruitment System

This project was developed during a hackathon organized by **Veo**, with the goal of creating an intelligent system to assist HR recruiters in evaluating candidates more effectively during video interviews.
This project was developed with a team of 6 engineering students. Each one had its own tasks to do. The project was finally presented as a website called AICRUIT.
